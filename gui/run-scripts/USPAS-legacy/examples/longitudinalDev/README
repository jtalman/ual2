      ./runLatest
            seems to run fine.

            it is a "script of scripts":
                  ./preProcess

                  ./preProcess2

                  ./runInNowModifiedUAL
 
On box

      ./runLatest
            doesn't seem to work, possibly because of scripts run inside scripts.

            catting out these scripts

                  ./preProcess

                  ./preProcess2

                  ./preProcess3

                  ./runInNowModifiedUAL
------>>>>>>      ./runManual

            and running them manually is the strategy for now (5/23/2021)
