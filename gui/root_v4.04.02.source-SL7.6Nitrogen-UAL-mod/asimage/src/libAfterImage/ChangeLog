	  TTF font: test.ttf.  Added nice defaults to all the sample apps,
	  so that ppl can see libAfterImage in its full beauty.
	* Adde Usage to all the examples. Fixed segfault in asscale. Added
	  error message on image file not found. Added texturized text

	* Temporarily plugged bug in layer merging descovered by allanon,
	  when bottommost layer does not have any image in it.
	* Reimplemented image output to allow for flexible support for many
	  image formats - right now it could be ASImage itself, XImage,
	  mask XImage and  ARGB32.  Surprisingly that simplified code quite
	  abit.  Fixed ugly bug in create_asimage.  Completed and debugged
	  astext tutorial.
	* fixed text size calculations; fixed (almost) bevel drawing  -
	  need to think about what to do with clip_width/height in Layer
	  specs

2001-07-04  sasha

	* fixed lots of bugs in glyph compressing and rendering, still
	  something is wrong with size calculation func. Added
	  move_asimage_channel to swap channels on images

2001-07-03  sasha

2001-06-09  sasha

	* made test to compile; Fixed several bugs in libAfterImage;
	  optimized 2bpp handling in xpm code; builtin xpm handler is about

	* updated configure scripts
	* further progress - src/test compiles now, but need to redo
	  libAfterImage/configure

	* rebuilt configure scripts
	* updated configure scripts to reflect addition of the xpm parsing
	  code
	* Completed custom xpm implementation. Needs to be debugged thou.

	* Split ASVisual from ScreenInfo and rearranged ARGB32.  Added
	  ASGradient to asimage.h and made gradient_t to be a synonym to
	  it.  That should allow for better library independancy - visual
	  will go with libAfterImage while ScreenInfo will move into
	  libAfterStep , or, possibly will split up even more.	Goal is to
	  make libAfterImage completely independant from everything else.

	  Added direction reverse to output method.

2001-05-09  sasha

	* Implemented vertical gradient drawing.  sorted out relationship
	  between channel numbering and ARGB32 component order - its the
	  same now.
	* fixed mono line encoding to add zero terminator at the end; fixed
	  scanline back_color initialization to have alpha at 0xFF; fixed
	  decoration layouting to not use stack memory in linked list;
	  fixed property event handler to initialize variable to NULL;
	  Afterstep now starts , althou does not do anything usefull

2001-05-08  sasha

	* coded gradients drawing using ASImages with smoothing and
	  dithering - works very blasted fast.	Fixed numerous include's
	  issues

2001-05-07  sasha

	* fixed create_screen_window for InputOnly windows fixed bug in
	  screen initialization where Colormap ID would get lost fixed bug
	  in desktop creation code where desktop->scr would never get
	  initialized.	Added show_progress function to work similarly to
	  show_warning/error Rearranged thresholds for output verbosity
	  Added stdargs.h  to import.c - suggested by Sean Dague

2001-05-04  sasha

	* completed ASFont implementation as needed at the moment - there
	  will need to be some work done in order to adapt it to locale
	  support.( as well as in several other places).  changed glyph
	  compression algorithm once again to run length encode only 0s and
	  FFs, and store rest in raw format. That allows to cut down on
	  memory since we don't use 2 bytes anymore.  3 step antialiasing
	  works now.  Off to image rotation and gradient drawing.

2001-05-03  sasha

	* Improved glyph compression algorithm so now it actually reduces
	  size, even on ery small fonts.  Tryed to implement additional
	  glyph smoothing, but something is wrong - disabled for now.

2001-05-02  sasha

	* fixed font drawing to group glyphs as close together as possible
	  - make for much nicer effect.
	* debugged X11 fonts loading and drawing. Still need to do
	  something about negative left bearings - ought to really offset a
	  pen to overlap charcters

2001-05-01  sasha

	* Implemented antialiasing for native X  fonts - still needs some
	  debuggin.

2001-04-30  sasha

	* added RLE compression to the font glyph cache.  added character
	  range specification for the font.  added right-to-left writing
	  order on per font basis.

2001-04-27  sasha

	* implemented text drawing using precached TTF fonts -- needs
	  addition of locale support in future.  Fixed image merging to do
	  clipping correctly.  Added image background color
	* fixed freetype headers problems and a bug in font hashing

2001-04-26  sasha

	* started implementing font manager and freetype support

2001-04-25  sasha

	* moved scanline merging functions into separate file
	* fixed most blending function so not to tresspass alpha channel
	  boundaries. Added tint_scanlines and implemented dissipation
	* fixed bug in image loading where piexls would get shifted by one
	  to the right.  added 14 image blending functions - almost
	  matching that of the GIMP's capabilities, except for multiply and
	  divide modes, which I don't see much sense in.  Added
	  RGB->HSV->RGB and RGB->HLS->RGB conversion functions.

2001-04-24  sasha

	* cleaned up output/encoding functionality.  Added quality
	  parameters to dynamically adjust quality on per image basis.
	  Implemented alpha blending and generic layer merging framework.

2001-04-23  sasha

	* debugged tiling functionality and optimized it so not to do
	  repeated compression on the same data. Added compression ratio
	  specification on per image basis.  OPtimized buffer copy to use
	  32bit data transfer. Implemented tinting( as a part of tiling
	  process ).
	* debugging tiler

2001-04-22  sasha

	* added tile_image() - needs debugging
	* ASImageDecoder

2001-04-20  sasha

	* added TIFF import and implemented generic image loading function
	  with search capabilities and subimage loading.  Fixed two more
	  bugs in image scaling.
	* added GIF import filter; added configure code to detect gif and
	  tiff libraries

2001-04-19  sasha

	* .CUR is the same as .ICO only type = 2
	* Added support for .PNM, .PPM, .ICO, .BMP image file formats -
	  TIFF and GIF to go

2001-04-18  sasha

	* xcf image loading now works, but only gets you first layer with
	  the same size as whole image. Need to implement layers merging
	  for ASImages to get complete support for GIMP's xcf files
	* fixed bug in xcf channel loading - theer are no such thing as
	  channel type

2001-04-17  sasha

	* most of the preparation work for xcf reading is done - now off to
	  actually create ASImage from it.  added code to poupulate
	  ASScanline with 0's where data is not available;

2001-04-16  sasha

	*  minor quality tweaks in rations 1-2 scaling up. Started
	  implementing ASImageDecoder for automatic tinting/tiling
	* IMplemented JPEG input filter for ASImage.  Fixed long standing
	  bug in image scaling causing wierdness in scaling UP with small
	  ratios.  Started implemntation of XCF file reader.

2001-04-15  sasha

	* implemented png file reader and fixed blatant bug in scale image
	  up where first line got garbadge in it

2001-04-13  sasha

	* compilation fixes
	* Implemented xpm loading into asimage. Updated asimage to
	  correctly use ScreenInfo.  implemented create_screen_pixmap and
	  create_screen_ximage
	* fixed test abit to not spit lots of warnings

2001-04-08  sasha

	* fixed bugs in scaling down code with ratio > 2; It appears that
	  you can create windows with different visual only if you create
	  new colormap and allocate border color from it as well. Fixed
	  screen.c accordingly. We keep black and white pixels and colormap
	  in ScreenInfo now - should use it instead of X macros

2001-04-06  sasha

	* implemented workaround for some stupid X servers that denys you
	  your constitutional right to use whatever Visual you like.
	* couple bugfixes for new visual handling code.  moved
	  ximage->scanline->ximage code from asimage.c to screen.c still
	  need to implement PseudoClor handling
	* hopefully fixed bug in 2x scaling up code

2001-04-05  sasha

	* no message
	* reworked ScreenInfo abit to include visual info.  Added screen.c
	  to libafterstep to collect together all the Screen/display
	  related stuff - ConnectX, MyXErrorHandle, and several new things
	  : init_screen and destroy_screen. nolock_mods has been moved
	  outside of the ScreenInfo as it is per-display and not per-screen
	  stuff. all_screens global variable holds pointers to all
	  ScreenInfo structrures for available screens. Added
	  query_visual_info to try and obtain best possible visual for
	  AfterStep to use. Need to move ximage->as->ximage conversion
	  stuff into screen.c. ConnectX now takes only one parameter -
	  pointer to ScreenInfo is discontinued
	* same old Ximage cleanup

2001-04-04  sasha

	* asimage->ximage debugging again - this time about 50% performance
	  increase.
	* more optimization to ximage output algorithm - that was the last
	  of it I'm sick and tired from this stuff

2001-04-03  sasha

	* Some tweaks to XImage writing code to speed things up - we were
	  spending upto 30% of time writing XImages - unacceptable.
	* fixed bug in line interpolation causing stripy artifacts in
	  scaling up
	* mmx debugged

2001-04-02  sasha

	* Added some MMX inline assembly to image scaling code to hopefully
	  make it faster -  need to verify if that indeed is the case.
	* aaa

2001-04-01  sasha

	* scaling speed optimizations

2001-03-31  sasha

	* debugged new scaling code - scale up is rather nice even with
	  huge ratio - check out src/test

2001-03-30  sasha

	* Implemented complete scaling Up procedure for arbitrary ratio -
	  if it'll work then similar stuff will go for 1-2 and 2-3 ratios.
	  Added reshape_winlist to WinList to actually generate layout of
	  titlebars based on WinList data and store pointers to them in
	  appropriate place in WMDecor structures. It now needs to be
	  debugged as a prototype for other modules.
	* debugged scaling down algorithm  - it now works and scale things
	  down rather nicely. Thus we have a proof of concept and can
	  proceed on to scaling up - which is mopstly implemented already

2001-03-29  sasha

	* completed implementation of scaling down of ASImages.  Added
	  dithering capabilities to ASImage->XImage conversion to hopefully
	  produce better results on 16bpp and 15bpp Fixed bug in ASWinLIst
	  message processing to create WinList if it did not exist.  Fixed
	  Bug in afterstep to initialize handlers in main window list to
	  correct functions.
	* defined structure of high level scaling API

2001-03-28  sasha

	* Added AS message reading/partiall handling to new WinList.  Moved
	  get_window_* functions into aswinlist.c Changed the way
	  process_message is called - it now takes ASMessage * as a param.
	  Made everything compiling.
	* some theory investigation into up scaling algorithms with
	  smoothing

2001-03-27  sasha

	* the best variant of compression algorithm - average compression
	  ratio is about 75for highly random images(nature) and 30for
	  regular images (naked body, etc.); no off to more exciting things

2001-03-26  sasha

	* no message
	* fixed compression code

2001-03-24  owsla

	* removed static keyword from libasimage_decode_line, this was
	  preventing it from being exported in the lib, which made the test
	  program fail

2001-03-23  sasha

	* optimized asimage decompression algorithm scaling down algorithm
	  implemented/.
	* extensive asimage debugging - compression now seems to work fine

2001-03-22  sasha

	* Completed implementation of Pixmap->ASImage->Pixmap cycle Now off
	  to debugging and implementing of scaling/alpha-blending/etc.

2000-12-12  sasha

	* libasimage has been renamed to libasGUI

2000-09-17  sasha

	* make_indent

2000-05-15  sasha

	* asImageFromXImageTest
