This "syntax" is to be followed exactly! The parenthesized Comments should be read.

Running as user ualusr2011 is required!

Historically, ualusr2011 has used ual1.

These instructions are for ual2.

Also, ualusr2011 has likely run many other applications.

These instructions overwrite the SHELL, tcsh, configuration file ~/.tcshrc.

You may want to save the current ~/.tcshrc file, to restore it after the ual2 install.

(Comment: possibly a little unfamiliar)

# setenv UAL `pwd`
# source setup-linux-ual

(Comment: check for errors with search string "rror " (note the trailing space, " "). This should give
 5 warnings, 2 ignorable, vestigial, "html errors".)
make clean
make >& make.log

cd gui/buildAL/source/

source ./all
      (Comment: this takes the better part of an hour! "Legacy qt", and "legacy root", ... must be built.
                error check of these builds follows via a gui run script example.)

cd ../../run-scripts/USPAS-legacy/examples/RT-transition/

./run-RT-transition
      launch "Bunch CT-DE" Animated Graph
            (verify transition, and RF phase change notification)
