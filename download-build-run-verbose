OVERVIEW:
   Running as user ualusr2011 is required!

   A specific directory
         /home/ualusr2011/git-gui-2/
   is required, as well.

   Shell tcsh must be used!

   A suggested "run commands" file is on the web at
         https://github.com/jtalman/ual2/blob/main/OS-and-SHELL/TCSHRC-ual2
   and in the cloned download at
         /home/ualusr2011/git-gui-2/ual2/OS-and-SHELL/TCSHRC-ual2
   It can be copied to ~/.tcshrc for subsequent use. It relies on an earlier clone of ual2.

   As usual, one should be careful about overwriting important files.

   The "noclobber" option may be relevant.

   Also, ualusr2011 may have run many other applications.

   Historically, ualusr2011 has used ual1.

   The current ~/.tcshrc file may very well be for ual1!

   These instructions are for ual2.

   The parenthesized c(C)omments should be read before executing the corresponding command.

   The pound sign, #, also designates a comment line.

   This "command line syntax" is to be followed exactly! A direct "copy and paste" might be best.

COMMAND LINE SYNTAX:

#     (Comment: open terminal
#               this should come up in the TENEX shell, tcsh.
#               this in turn is initialized from file ~/.tcshrc)

#     (Comment: note the implied user, ualusr2011, and directory, ~/git-gui-2/)
cd /home/ualusr2011/git-gui-2/

#     (Comment: this directory may already exist! Remove it, or rename it. You may want to restore it, later.)
git clone https://github.com/jtalman/ual2

#     (Commented out)
#cp ual2/OS-and-SHELL/TCSHRC-ual2 ~/.tcshrc
#     (Comment: this file may already exist! Remove it, or rename it. You may want to restore it, later.
#               This line is optional. You're likely to have your own ~/.tcshrc file!
#               These next 5 commands are pulled into this example.)

cd ual2/legacy/ual1
#     (Comment: possibly a little unfamiliar.
#               ual2 is intended to facilitate the latest developments on AlmaLinux 9.
#               ual1 is now viewed as "legacy", hence a subdirectory.
#               $UAL used to be the central environmental variable.
#               $UAL2 is intended to be the new central environmental variable.)

setenv UAL `pwd`
source setup-linux-ual

make clean
make >& make.log
#     (Comment: check for errors with search string "rror " (note the trailing space, " "). This should give
#      5 warnings, 2 ignorable, vestigial, "html errors".)
#     (Comment: this takes ca 10 - 15 minutes on a W530 Thinkpad.)

cd gui/buildAL/source/

source ./all
#     (Comment: this can take the better part of an hour on a slow box! It takes ca 25 minutes to half an hour on W530.
#               "legacy qt", and "legacy root", ... are being built.
#               A list of the built libraries is provided.
#               Error check of these builds is next via a gui run script example.)
