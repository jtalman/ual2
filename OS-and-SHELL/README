AlmaLinux 9 is assumed installed.

A "work station" install is likely a good start.

As mentioned elsewhere, the user for this work is "ualusr2011", assumed created.

Running
          cd OS-and-SHELL
          su
                    root password
          source OS-extras
as root might make sense for your installation.
