Producing lattice plots using gnuplot, 7 Sept 2019
--------------------------------------------------
This augments "Readme.txt".

1. To produce a lattice funtion plot for lattice, say,
         SXF_TRACKER/data/VLLCnoDSUPP-mod.sxf
this sxf file needs to start with the string "ring" 

2. and be asssigned the conventional name "ring.sxf"
   From the SXF_TRACKER diretory run
       $ cp data/VLLCnoDSUPP-mod.sxf data/ring.sxf

3. From the same directory run
       $ ./tracker
to produce 
         out/cpp/ring.twiss
(along, optionally, with other output files, 
"ring.map1", and echo of "ring.sxf")

4. that need to have their correct names applied>
From the SXF_TRACKER/out/cpp directory, run
       $ mv ring.twiss VLLCnoDSUPP-mod.twiss
       $ mv ring.map1 VLLCnoDSUPP-mod.map1
       $ mv ring.sxf VLLCnoDSUPP-mod.sxf

5. Then, from the SXF_TRACKER/out/cpp directory, run
       $ gnuplot
       gnuplot> load "gnuplot/twiss/VLLCnoDSUPP-modTwiss.gnuplot"
which produces
         pdf/VLLCnoDSUPP-modTwiss.pdf
and (in this case) also 
         pdf/IP-VLLCnoDSUPP-mod.pdf

6. They can be viewed (for example) by
       $ evince pdf/IP-VLLCnoDSUPP-modTwiss.pdf  pdf/VLLCnoDSUPP-modTwiss.pdf

NOTES
-----
1. Missing names in column 2 of the ".twsss" messes up the plots. Add a dummy
name such as "-" to fix the problem. 

2. pdfcairo does not handle "_" underscore symbol correctly in "enhanced" mode. 
Either remove the "enhanced" argument or use a different gnuplot terminal or 
rename the ".twiss" file, getting rid of the underscore symbol.

3. For .sxf files wit lattice identifier different from "ring", for 
example, instead "muon" ( as in lattice files muon0.13_R5m-RFon.sxf or
muon0.13_R5m.sxf) it is necessary to make the replacement (judiciously,
because "muon" may not refer to the lattice name)
         ring --> muon
in "tracker.cc". Compare "tracker.cc" and "tracker-muon.cc". 

4. I use "evince" to display ".pdf" files.

5. There are bugs in 
          E-ValLeb2-sl4.sxf
          E-Protonium.sxf
               void TeapotTwissService::define 
               wrong map , cos(mu) =1 
               see map in the map_wrong.out file 
               STOP. TeapotTwissService.
