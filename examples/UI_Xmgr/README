October 19, 2015,   Revised Procedure
-------------------------------------
At present the "xmgr" command file "xyzfft.com" looks for tracking output
data in ./out/test.  But the new policy puts the tracking output in a 
directory 
              ./out/$jobname
where "jobname" is the name of the lattice being tracked,
for example "data/AlmostPureBend.mad"

Therefore, before launching a PERL script, such as "shell_AlmostPureBend.pl", 
it is necessary to make a soft link 
                   test -> AlmostPureBend/
in the 
          /home/ualusrPERL/ual1220/ual1/examples/UI_Xmgr/out 
directory
