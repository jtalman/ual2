This subdirectory is pretty developmental.

The pure ezxml parsing seems to work fine.

A somewhat fleshed out "Experimental UAL" example for PTR_m_nomEQ0p0.32349_sl4.adxf is in
      ./Ring-PTR_m_nomEQ0p0.32349_sl4.adxf/

Incipient "Experimental UAL" files for "repurposed COSY" are in
      ./Ring-figure-eight/
