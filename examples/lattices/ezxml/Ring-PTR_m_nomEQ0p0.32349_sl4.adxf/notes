This is the current working program directory. It is based on PTR_m_nomEQ0p0.32349_sl4.adxf

New development, with a new adxf file, is outlined in ../create-Ring/

Useful utilities for this, and generally, are in ../ezxml/. ../ezxml/notes may be of interest. Possibly interesting legacy info is also in ../ezxml/.
