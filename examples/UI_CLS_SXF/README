Description:
------------------------------------------

Starter example UI with the SXF file CLS.sxf (Canadian Light Source)

Usage:
------------------------------------------

$ perl UI_CLS_SXF-256.pl       # to run full perl script
$ perl -d UI_CLS_SXF-256.pl   # to step through perl script enter "n" (for next step)
                                               # after that "n" or CR
Structure:
------------------------------------------

CLS.pl     - Perl script 
./data/CLS.sxf 
./out/  - directory with output files

Comments concerning the graphical output and "xmgrace"
------------
1.  A common failure will be for all graphs produced in the final step of the perl 
     scipt to be blank, except for the axes.
2.  Essentially always, all previous perl steps will still be valid.
3.  The error will probably have been caused by a change in the "xyzfft.com" 
      file, which instructs "xmgrace" how to produce the graphs.
4.  Though "xmgrace" is both powerful (e.g. it performs fft's on the fly) and
      elegant (it's "xyzfft.com" file handles pictorial rearrangements) its learning
      curve is steep.
5.  As an aid to climbing this hill, several different  "xyzfft.com" scripts are 
     available in the "xyzfft.com_dir" directory.
6.  The only purpose for this (annoying) soft link redirection is to enable the 
     user to correlate changes in the graphical appearance (e.g. presence or
     absence of timestamp) with changes in "xyzfft.com" file.
7.  More trivial cosmetic  "Console" warnings may still persist.

Comments concerning UAL
------------
1.  All energies are measured in GEV
2.  This includes electric field units being GeV/m
3. "mass" is always mc^2, always in GeV units
3.  "energy" is always "total energy"
4.  i.e. E = mc^2 + K
5. gamma = E/mc^2 > 1 for m>0.
