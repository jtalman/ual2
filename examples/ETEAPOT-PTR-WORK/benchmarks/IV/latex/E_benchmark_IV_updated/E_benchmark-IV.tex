\begin{abstract}
This chapter compares the results of various lattice 
programs for Valeri Lebedev's all-electric proton EDM lattice, 
(here referred to as {\tt E\_ValLeb2-sl4-RF.sxf}).
The full-scale ``Holy Grail'' lattice later adopted for
the RSI EDM paper\cite{RSI-lattrice} is essentially similar, 
but with larger radius and conservatively smaller electric field.
As required for EDM measurement sensitivity, these lattices have 
significantly stronger focusing horizontally than vertically. 

For transverse optics the agreement among three independent 
analyses, two based on the Wollnik transfer matrix formalism, 
one using the ETEAPOT lattice simulation code, is excellent. 
Plots and tables bear this out.

The comparison of longitudinal dynamics is somewhat less
satisfactory. A crude comparison between ETEAPOT 
and Runge-Kutta analysis of longitudinal dynamics in a
previous benchmark lattice {\tt E\_BM\_Z-RF.sxf} is given. 
Factors making such comparisons delicate are discussed. 
The importance of proving beam capture into stable longitudinal 
buckets is emphasized. In fact, unlike {\tt E\_BM\_Z-RF.sxf},
attempts to achieve stable capture into the 
{\tt E\_ValLeb2-sl4-RF.sxf} lattice have failed so far.
It is not known at present whether this is a property of the
lattice, which would be surprising, or a bug in ETEAPOT.

\section{Parameters of Benchmark Proton EDM Lattices}
Transverse Twiss parameters have been calculated from linearized transfer matrices
in two different ways, one described in this report, and referred to as R.M.T.
(using MAPLE), 
and one from the initial Lebedev report\cite{ValLeb2} and referred to as V.L. 
Both of these analyses are based on the Wollnik\cite{Wollnik} linearized transfer 
matrix formalism. As such, they are independent only as regards lattice details, 
element slicing, and interpretation of the formalism. The third analysis, based
on ETEAPOT computer simulation, is here referred to as J.D.T. 

The ETEAPOT approach is to perform exact tracking in an approximate lattice, 
and to reconstruct the Twiss parameters by numerical post-processing the 
results from tracking a standard bunch of 21 small amplitude particles.
Being based on entirely different formalisms, the comparison of ETEAPOT and
Wollnik-based results can provide a stringent test of our understanding of 
the proposed proton EDM lattice.

Comparisons of transverse lattice parameters are given in Table~\ref{tbl:TransverseParams}
and, in more detail, for a quite similar December 2013 Lebedev ring, in the table shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:ValLebedevDec2013-parms}.
The R.M.T and J.D.T. analyses are based on lattice file {\tt ValLeb2-sl4.sxf} which
has been reconstructed from the original Lebedev\cite{ValLeb2} report. The lattice
is simple enough, and the Lebedev report careful and thorough enough, that this
reconstruction could be performed with little ambiguity. The only significant
uncertainty was that only the ratio of quadrupole fields GDD/GFF, rather than
the absolute quad strengths (i.e. inverse focal lengths) is given in the report 
\cite{ValLeb2}. The tunes $Q_x$ and $Q_y$ are given, however, and, from these, 
the absolute (half-)quad strengths $qFh$ and $qDh$ have been determined.

In the {\tt ValLeb2-sl4.sxf} latice description file, the ``{\tt -sl4}'' indicates
that the bend elements have been artificially sliced by a factor of four, from
about 9 meters to about 2.25 meters. This has been done both for making the
physical construction more realistic, and to relieve the burden on ETEAPOT tracking
over such long elements. As it happens, ETEAPOT automatically performs a further
splitting of a factor of two, to make lattice parameters available at element
centers. Also ETEAPOT can perform further splitting in order to represent bend
elements having field indices other than $m=0$ (which corresponds to ``cylindrical''
bent-planar, parallel electrodes). For the present study we fix $m=0$, except in
Lebedev's $m=0.199$ ``weak-focusing'' option, with parameters given in the left column
of Figure~\ref{fig:ValLebedevDec2013-parms}.

Table~\ref{tbl:TransverseParams} shows excellent agreement among the three approaches.
With $qFh$ constrained to be identical for all studies, the main discrepancy was
assuming $m=0.235$ in the TEAPOT calculation, whereas the Lebedev calculation
assumed $m=0.199$.
A discrepancy at least this large can be expected from the fundamental ambiguity
in the treatment of electric elements, especially in the comparison between
ETEAPOT and Wollnik approaches.  As it happens there is little
difference in the treatments based on the identical lattice description file, 
and the entire discrepancy is between V.L. and R.M.T. implementations of 
the Wollik approach on slightly different lattices. In any case all
comparisons are sufficiently good that there can be little doubt the
transverse lattice performance will be essentially just as Lebedev has 
first stated. One must keep in mind, however, that the lattice with 
unbalanced focusing is quite ``high strung''.  For example, a 1\%
change in the $qDh$ focal length reduces $Q_y$ from 0.3 to 0.0 (where
the lattice becomes unstable). 

R.M.T. linear transfer matrix Twiss functions are compared to J.D.T. ETEAPOT
Twiss functions in Figures~\ref{WollnikVsETEAPOT-x} and \ref{WollnikVsETEAPOT-y}. 
V.L. linear transfer matrix Twiss functions are compared to ETEAPOT
Twiss functions in following figures. 
There is excellent agreement in all cases.

\subsection{Fractional off-momentum notation\label{sec:FracLongitOffset}}
To call attention to one complication accompanying the introduction of
electric elements, we define here multiple fractional longitudinal offset 
variables: starting with ``fractional rigidity offset'' $\delta_R$ 
and ``fractional total energy offset'' $\delta$.  For magnetic lattices 
the latter quantity will also be referred to as $\delta_{UAL}$; it is the 
fractional longitudinal phase space coordinate definition used by MAD and UAL 
(and now also by ETEAPOT). Its definition is
%
\begin{equation}
\delta_{UAL} = \frac{\mathcal{E}-\mathcal{E}_0}{p_0c},
\label{eq:Notation.1}
\end{equation}
%
where $p_0$ is the design momentum, 
$\mathcal{E}=\gamma m_pc^2 + eV({\bf x})$ is the total energy
and $\gamma$ is the conventional relativistic parameter. 
The ``mechanical energy'' is $\gamma m_pc^2$. For magnetic elements, because
$\gamma$ is conserved, this definition is applicable either 
inside or outside bend elements. For electric elements (for
which it is $\mathcal{E}$ that is conserved)
$\gamma$ varies (discontinuously at step function voltage changes)
as a particle moves between regions of different electric potential.

It needs to be agreed that, for comparing differently derived 
results, that it is parameter values \emph{outside} electric
elements that should be compared, even if the ring is mainly bends
and particles are \emph{rarely}
``outside bends''. To avoid confusion, quantities can
be specified with superscript ``O'' for ``outside''
or ``I'' for ``inside''.

The defining equation for ``fractional rigidity offset'' $\delta_R$ is
%
\begin{equation}
R = R_0(1+\delta_R),
\label{eq:Notation.2}
\end{equation}
%
where $R_0$ is the radius of the design circular orbit
and $R$ is the radius of the orbit (locally circular) of
the offset particle in the same local field. By this definition
$\delta_R$ is identical to (or at least very close to) 
Wollnik's\cite{Wollnik} $\Delta$, which he defines in his 
Section 4.1.1.2. (For a uniform electric or any magnetic field 
the ``at least very close to''
qualification is unnecessary. For a non-uniform electric field
one has to follow Wollnik's definitions more carefully.

ETEAPOT uses $\delta_{UAL}$, defined above as the sixth phase space 
component of a particle being tracked through a lattice. 
(However, $\delta_{UAL}$ cannot be
used to differentiate between orbits of different radii inside a 
bend element having electric field proportional to $1/r$;
this is because the dependence of radius on mechanical energy is 
singular. (Regrettably the optimal EDM bend field varies approximately
as $1/r$.)   Outside electrical field regions,
%
\begin{equation}
\delta_{UAL} = \frac{(\gamma^O-\gamma_0)m_pc^2}{p_0c}.
\label{eq:Notation.3}
\end{equation}
%
In drifts (or magnets) this is identical to Eq.~(\ref{eq:Notation.1}).

By design, in all-electric rings, the electric potential is 
\emph{everywhere} zero on the design orbit. Element errors will cause 
the central closed orbit to deviate somewhat from the design orbit. 
Except for this $\gamma^O=\gamma^I$ on the central closed orbit.

At arbitrary, inside or outside, bends, the longitudinal deviation 
variable $\delta_{UAL}$ used 
in MAD and UAL is defined by
%
\begin{equation}
\delta_{UAL}
 = 
\frac{\Delta\mathcal{E}_{\rm mech.}}{p_0c}
 =
\frac{m_pc^2\Delta\gamma}{p_0c}.
\label{eq:chromatic.2}
\end{equation}
%
Here $\mathcal{E}_{\rm mech.}=\gamma m_pc^2$ stands for the 
``mechanical energy'', which is the total energy minus the
potential energy. One then finds
%
\begin{equation}
\Delta(pv)
 = 
m_p\Delta(\gamma v^2)
 =
m_pc^2\Delta
\Big(
\gamma - \frac{1}{\gamma}
\Big)
 =
\Big(
1 + \frac{1}{\gamma_0^2}
\Big)\,
\frac{p_0v_0}{\beta_0}\,\delta_{UAL},
\label{eq:chromatic.3}
\end{equation}
%
and
%
\begin{equation}
pv
 \approx
p_0v_0\,
\bigg(
1 + \Big(1 + \frac{1}{\gamma_0^2}\Big)\,\frac{1}{\beta_0}\,\delta_{UAL}.
\bigg)
\label{eq:chromatic.4}
\end{equation}
%
As defined here, the fractional rigidity deviation $\Delta$ relates the
radius of curvature $r$ of a deviant particle to the 
radius of curvature $r_0$ of an on-momentum particle, both in the
same uniform field;
%
\begin{equation}
r = r_0\,(1+\Delta).
\label{eq:chromatic.6p}
\end{equation}
%
$\Delta$ is therefore related to the MAD/UAL momentum deviation 
factor $\delta$ by\footnote{For comparison with Wollnik's
Eq.~(4.58c) one should note that Wollnik's 
$\delta_K=(K-K_0)/K_0$ is a fractional kinetic energy,
while our MAD/UAL $\delta=(E-E_0)/p_0c$. The numerators are
the same but our denominator is bigger by $p_0c/K_0=3.01$.}
%
\begin{equation}
\Delta 
 =
\Big(1 + \frac{1}{\gamma_0^2}\Big)\,\frac{1}{\beta_0}\,\delta_{UAL}
\quad
\big(
 = 
2.744\,\delta_{UAL}
\big).
\label{eq:chromatic.6q}
\end{equation}
%
for the all-electric proton EDM experiment. 

This (surprisingly large) factor accounts for much of the large difference
in Lebedev and ETEAPOT determinatons of ring dispersion.

\section{Comparison of Longitudinal Dynamics}
Though transverse dynamics in all-electric proton EDM rings is now 
completely under control, the same cannot be said for longitudinal
dynamics.  From now on it will be important, appropriate, and possible, 
to concentrate more on longitudinal dynamics.  

In the early days, benchmark comparisons of results of ETEAPOT and Runge-Kutta 
tracking showed seemingly contradictory results. For example ETEAPOT 
tracking\cite{Benchmark-III} 
showed long term instability limiting the dynamic aperture
to be about an order of magnitude less than given by Runge-Kutta 
tracking\cite{YKS-tracking}. We have now
realized that this inconsistency may be partially understood in terms of
the vastly disparate peak RF voltages that were being assumed for the
two studies. In both cases harmonic number $h=100$ was assumed, but 
the largest peak RF voltage in the ETEAPOT study was 5\,KV, whereas, 
in the Runge-Kutta study the peak voltage was 1\,MV. 
This factor of 200 difference can certainly be expected to affect the
comparison. Extending the range of RF voltages in the ETEAPOT study 
to 0.1\,MV (above which instability results) one obtains the comparison 
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:YKS-ETEAPOT-compare}. This is not intended
as evidence of ``agreement'' between the results; rather it is intended 
as a beginning on the route to eventual, more controlled, comparison. 
Complications in performing such comparisons are discussed next.

In Figure~\ref{fig:YKS-ETEAPOT-compare}
the three Runge-Kutta traces correspond
to initial $x$-amplitudes of -1\,cm (blue), 0 (green), and 
+1\,cm (red), all with $\Delta p/p=2\times10^{-4}$. 
(For the ETEAPOT plot, for the same three cases, in the same order, the 
colors are red, green, blue, blue.)
The x-ranges 
of both plots are about the same. For the Runge-Kutta plot
the RF voltage was 1\,MV. For the
ETEAPOT plot the RF voltage was 0.1\,MV
(approximately the highest voltage for which the
particles could be captured into stable buckets). This
comparison is discussed (and qualified) further in the text.
\begin{figure}[hbt]

\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{pdf/Yannis-RungeKutta.pdf}\\
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{pdf/BM-IV_Figure5r.pdf}
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{pdf/BM-IV_Figure5r-early.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:YKS-ETEAPOT-compare}Comparison of
(Figure 18 of reference\cite{YKS-tracking}) 
Runge-Kutta tracking (above) with ETEAPOT tracking
(middle). One sees betatron oscillations, as modulated by
10-times slower, radially-offset synchrotron oscillations. 
(This is easier to
decipher in the early turns shown in the bottom plot.)
A noticeable difference between these figures is that upper
figure, Runge-Kutta orbits, are centered horizontally 
(implying zero dispersion for $\Delta p/p=2\times10^{-4}$ fractional
momentum offset) while the lower figure orbits are displaced 
outwards by about 0.014\,cm,
roughly consistent with the MAPLE-evaluated dispersion shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:MAPLE-dispersion}). }
\end{figure}
Though it has been stated that the same lattice (namely {\tt E\_BM\_Z-RF.sxf})
has been used in the ETEAPOT/Runge-Kutta comparison, this is only approximately
true, especially as regards the (weak) vertical focusing needed to preserve
vertical stability. Furthermore the $m$-values are slightly different.
These blemishes are not expected to be significant.

The ETEAPOT/Runge-Kutta comparison in Figure~\ref{fig:YKS-ETEAPOT-compare}
is as close as it is only because various empirical adjustments
(for example resolving ambiguous lattice details to make the plots look
more similar) have been made. While it has been easy to specify 
transverse-sensitive lattice 
conditions unambiguously it is harder to specify longitudinal
conditions. The effective beta-functions and dispersions are unkown
for the Runge-Kutta plot, which probably accounts for the twice greater
transverse range of the Runge-Kutta orbits. Also 
there is ambiguity as to whether the beam is specified 
inside or outside electric field regions; the change in kinetic
energy in passing from inside to outside affects this specification.
It is also important to specify where in the ring the RF cavity is
situated, as beam capture depends on this. If the RF cavity is
at the beginning or end of the lattice (as is convenient for such studies) 
it is essential to know whether the beam is injected just before or
just after the RF. More generally, the specification of longitudinal
performance depends on the full, six-dimensions in phase space,
of the initial bunch distribution.

The fine grain structure of the ETEAPOT and Runge-Kutta plots in
Figure~\ref{fig:YKS-ETEAPOT-compare} are similar. By counting red peaks one
finds the ``synchrotron tune'' $Q_s$ of this granularity to be 
$Q_s=9.9/2000=0.005$ for the ETEAPOT plot. (Though it is not possible to infer 
it from the fuzzy plot) this is the same for all three traces; 
see Figure~\ref{fig:RK-compare-longit}. For the outermost
(red) Runge-Kutta plot there are 14 periods in 0.0005\,s, which corresponds to
357 turns. This yields $Q_s=14/357=0.039$. Again, the blue and green peaks
are too fuzzy to be counted in the figure as reproduced here. But the
plots in the original report\cite{YKS-tracking} are clearer, and there
seem to be 15.5 green peaks over the same interval that there are 14
red peaks. If true, it would imply the red and green particles have not
been captured in the same bucket. This should be checked. 

To illustrate these issues further, the top plot of 
Figure~\ref{fig:RK-compare-longit}
shows the longitudinal phase space evolution corresponding 
to the ETEAPOT data in the middle 
Figure~\ref{fig:YKS-ETEAPOT-compare}. An essential aspects of
this figure is that the longitudinal phase space orbits are identical
in the three cases, and the particles are limited to the longitudinal
range from -0.019\,m to +0.019\,m. In other words, the particles have
been captured into a stable bucket. This limitation, specific to capture
into a stable bucket, cannot easily be inferred from 
Figure~\ref{fig:YKS-ETEAPOT-compare}.

Comparisons of longitudinal dynamics will eventually require
the comparison of entire beam bunches, with realistic spreads
in all phase space dimensions. A small step in this direction
is indicated in Figure~\ref{fig:Centroid}.

a single particle on the left, and for the centroid of a bunch
of 21 particles in the middle, both for 2000 turns. On the right 
the transverse momentum is plotted for 21500 turns.} 
\end{figure}
The figure is based on 
the longitudinal evolution for 2000 turns of a bunch of 21 particles
initially distributed on-momentum, with zero momentum spread,
and zero angular spread, but uniformly distributed 
radially on the range $-5\,{\rm mm}<x<5\,{\rm mm}$.
The trace on the left is that of a single particle; its
amplitude is more-or-less constant. The trace in the middle is 
that of the centroid of all 21 particles. Its lack of constancy
is due to decoherence, followed by partial recoherence, of
the particles of different amplitude. The figure on the right
shows the centroid momentum plotted for about ten times as many
turns.  Though any one particle executes constant betatron plus
synchrotron oscillations, the centroid drifts quasi-randomly
due to the accidental coherence and decoherence of 21 
particles. (With a real beam of $10^{10}$ particles this fluttery
variation would be negligible.)

As mentioned in the abstract, attempts to achieve stable capture 
into the {\tt E\_ValLeb2-sl4-RF.sxf} lattice have failed so far.
This has not been for want of trying. Hundreds of, admittedly disorganized, 
attempts, including many with the wrong RF frequency, and/or the wrong
RF phase, have been made without success so far. In any case this curious
result is not understood at present.
