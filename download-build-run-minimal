setenv UAL `pwd`

make clean
make >& make.log
      (Comment: check for errors with search string "rror " (note the trailing space, " "). This should give
       5 warnings, 2 ignorable, vestigial, "html errors.)

cd gui/buildAL/source/

source ./all
      (Comment: error check of this follows, via a gui run script example.)
                this takes the better part of an hour! "Legacy qt", and "legacy root" must be built.)

./run-RT-transition
      launch "Bunch CT-DE" Animated Graph
            (verify transition, and RF phase change notification)
