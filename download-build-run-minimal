This "syntax" is to be followed exactly!

Running as user ualusr2011 is required! A specific directory, ~/git-gui-2/, as well.

Historically, ualusr2011 has used ual1. These instructions are for ual2.

Also, ualusr2011 has likely run many other applications.

As usual, one should be careful about overwriting important files.

The parenthesized c(C)omments should be read before executing the corresponding command.

cd /home/ualusr2011/git-gui-2/
#     (Comment: note the implied user, ualusr2011)

git clone https://github.com/jtalman/ual2
#     (Comment: this directory may already exist! Remove it, or rename it. You may want to restore it, later.)

#cp ual2/OS-and-SHELL/TCSHRC-ual2 ~/.tcshrc
#     (Comment: this file may already exist! Remove it, or rename it. You may want to restore it, later.
#               This line is optional. You're likely to have your own ~/.tcshrc file!)

cd ual2/legacy/ual1
#     (Comment: possibly a little unfamiliar)

setenv UAL `pwd`
source setup-linux-ual

make clean
make >& make.log
#     (Comment: check for errors with search string "rror " (note the trailing space, " "). This should give
#      5 warnings, 2 ignorable, vestigial, "html errors".)

cd gui/buildAL/source/

source ./all
#     (Comment: this can take the better part of an hour on a slow box!
#               "legacy qt", and "legacy root", ... must be built.
                error check of these builds is next via a gui run script example.)
