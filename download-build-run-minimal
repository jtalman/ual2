Running as user ualusr2011 is required! A specific directory

      /home/ualusr2011/git-gui-2/

as well.

Shell tcsh must be used!

A suggested "run commands" file is on the web at

      https://github.com/jtalman/ual2/blob/main/download-build-run-minimal

and in the download at

      /home/ualusr2011/git-gui-2/ual2/OS-and-SHELL/TCSHRC-ual2

It can be copied to ~/.tcshrc

As usual, one should be careful about overwriting important files. The "noclobber" option may be relevant.

Historically, ualusr2011 has used ual1.

These instructions are for ual2.

Also, ualusr2011 may have run many other applications.

The parenthesized c(C)omments should be read before executing the corresponding command.

The pound sign, #, also designates a comment line.

This "command line syntax" is to be followed exactly!

git clone https://github.com/jtalman/ual2

#     (Comment: this file may already exist! Remove it, or rename it. You may want to restore it, later.
#               This line is optional. You're likely to have your own ~/.tcshrc file!)
#               These next 5 commands are pulled into this example.)

cd ual2/legacy/ual1

setenv UAL `pwd`
source setup-linux-ual

make clean
make >& make.log
#     (Comment: check for errors with search string "rror " (note the trailing space, " "). This should give
#      5 warnings, 2 ignorable, vestigial, "html errors".)

cd gui/buildAL/source/

source ./all
#     (Comment: this can take the better part of an hour on a slow box!
#               "legacy qt", and "legacy root", ... must be built.
#               A list of the built libraries is provided.
#               Error check of these builds is next via a gui run script example.)
