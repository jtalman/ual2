Directory
	$UAL/doc/
is built separately for the time being.

A (the?) critical question is the availability of executable dot, e.g.
	/home/rtalman/graphviz/INSTALL-10.0.1/bin/dot 22192
on my SL7.9 box.

Tar file
	/home/rtalman/graphviz/graphviz-10.0.1.tar.gz 27286181
is in $UAL/doc/tars/

Executable dot has been built with it, and tested on my box.

Of course it must be available via
	$PATH
for make
	$UAL/doc/Makefile
to execute successfully.

One can then browse to e.g.
	file:///home/rtalman/Desktop/GIT/download/ual1/doc/src/html/annotated.html
on my box.
