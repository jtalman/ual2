Benchmark-III Instructions, 16 Nov. 2019      Thu Dec  5  2024   Quick check; run full Benchmark,
                                                                                                                          then compare new with old
--------------------------
1. Assume git download and build have been completed, and environment variables
   correctly set.

2. $ cd $UAL/examples/ETEAPOT-benchmarks/III
   (Necessary server-side modification may be applied initially.) 
   $ ll runExample*   // provides list (just one in this case)
             runExampleFor_ETEAPOT_BM-III-MltTurn-mod

3. Copy and paste from entire file.

4. The produced pdf files (in /pdf directory) are
          BM-III_Figure11.pdf
          BM-III_Figure10.pdf
          BM-III_Figure9.pdf
          BM-III_Figure8.pdf
          BM-III_Figure7.pdf
          delta_vs_ct_V0p02.pdf
          delta_vs_turn_V0p02.pdf
          delta_vs_ct_V0p05.pdf
          delta_vs_turn_V0p05.pdf
          delta_vs_ct_V0p1.pdf
          delta_vs_turn_V0p1.pdf
          delta_vs_ct_V0p2.pdf
          delta_vs_turn_V0p2.pdf
          delta_vs_ct_V0p5.pdf
          delta_vs_turn_V0p5.pdf
          delta_vs_ct_V1p0.pdf
          delta_vs_turn_V1p0.pdf
          delta_vs_ct_V2p0.pdf
          delta_vs_turn_V2p0.pdf
          delta_vs_ct_V5p0.pdf
          delta_vs_turn_V5p0.pdf
          BM-III_Figure4b.pdf
          BM-III_Figure4m.pdf
          BM-III_Figure4t.pdf
          BM-III_Figure3.pdf

5. The /latex directory contains tar 
         latex/E_benchmark_III.tar
   (possibly along with other files or a directory)
         latex/E_benchmark_III_updated/

6. "pdf" files produced in step 4 should be 
   copied to directory "E_benchmark_III_updated/pdf" before issuing
         $ cd latex/E_benchmark_III_updated
         $ pdflatex E_benchmark_III-updated.tex
   to produce chapter "E_benchmark-III.pdf".

NOTE: All figure numbers are displaced by 2 from the figure numbers in the
      report because the first two figures in the original report have been
      suppressed.
