Running
      make clean
      make
in the root directory generates the
      ./getTwissWithShell/getTwissWithShell,
      ./getMapWithOpticsCalculator/getMapWithOpticsCalculator,
and
      ./getOrbitWithShell
executables.

These are all based on input file
      ./working.sxf
It may be set via e.g.
      rm -f ./working.sxf
      ln -s ../E2_Track/sxf/E_pEDM-rtr1-preMobius.RF.sxf ./working.sxf

Running
      ./getTwissWithShell/getTwissWithShell
in the root directory generates
      ./working.twiss

Running
      ./getMapWithOpticsCalculator/getMapWithOpticsCalculator
in the root directory generates
      ./working.map1

Running
      ./getOrbitWithShell/getOrbitWithShell dummy 646617.830 -1.2 0 1 0.02 10 > ./working.orbit
in the root directory generates
      ./working.orbit

These can be archived/renamed as the user deems fit. Some care about not losing them in the clean is warranted.

These also may rewrite some "server side" functionality. Recloning (and rebuilding) may be warranted.
