ETEAPOT-benchmarks/I  Instructions, 3 Dec. 2022, later, 3 August, 2023
-------------------------------
1. Assume git download and build have been completed, and environment variables
   correctly set.
2. These examples (tediously, several minute long) produce a great deal of print-out as example of one way 
producing debugging information rather than using a debugger, such as "ddd" or "gdb".   Later one introduced PTR
to replace ORIG files (in ORIG-BM-runExamples) by PTR files {\bf with the same names} (in PTR-BM-runExamples)
with changed m_nom values as well as changed radius (30->11) which is, in any case, just a "dummy" input
This also required duplication of all the benchmark gnuplot files
    $ cd $UAL/examples/ETEAPOT-benchmarks/I
    $ ll run*  #  produces  
                                           runExample_Figure_3
                                           runExample_Figure_2
                                           runExample_Figure_3-Z-sl-ORIGonly
                                           runExample_Figure_4
                                           runExample_Figure_3-Z-sl-modQ-ORIGonly
for which these first five of the scripts are needed only to reproduce ORIGINAL benchmark runs, and
                                          runExample_Figure-p19
                                          runExample_Figure-p29
                                          runExample_Figure-p32
                                          runExample_Figure-p39
3. In each these four cases cut and paste from each entire file---they are all run scripts--- each concluding by opening 
"gnuplot" waiting for a gnuplot script to produce plots.   Unstable lattices produce error messages and no plots.

4. The following produced pdf files (saved in /pdf directory) are originally  EDM ring, later PTR.  
                                                 Fig-p39-b.pdf
                                                 Fig-p39-t.pdf
                                                 Fig-p32-b.pdf
                                                 Fig-p32-t.pdf
                                                 Fig-p29-b.pdf
                                                 Fig-p29-t.pdf
                                                 Fig-p19-b.pdf
                                                 Fig-p19t.pdf
This will have produced most of the files eventually required to be present in this directory

5.  The matching gnuplot files (in ".../gnuplot and already used)  are  
                           PTR-BM-I_Figure-p19.gnuplot
                           PTR-BM-I_Figure-p29.gnuplot
                           PTR-BM-I_Figure-p32.gnuplot
                           PTR-BM-I_Figure-p39.gnuplot

6. The latex directory contains files
         latex/E_benchmark_I.tar
         E_benchmark_I-updated.pdf
   and (possibly) directory 
         E_benchmark_I_updated/
   If not present, this directory can be regenerated using "E_benchmark_I.tar" 
   in step 7.  Otherwise proceed to step 8. 

7.      $ cd latex
         $ tar xvf E_benchmark_I.tar
   produces latex production directory
         E_benchmark_I_updated/
  including 
         E_benchmark_I_updated/pdf

8. The pdf files produced in step 4 are presumed to have been 
    copied to directory "latex/E_benchmark_I_updated/pdf ../latex/PTR_benchmark_I_updated/pdf" before issuing
         $ cd E_benchmark_I_updated
         $ pdflatex E_benchmark_I-updated.tex
   to produce chapter "E_benchmark-I.pdf".
