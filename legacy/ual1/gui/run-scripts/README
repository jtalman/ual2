I'm focussing on the example in directory
       $UAL/gui/run-scripts/USPAS-legacy/examples/RT-transition/

cd into this directory, and execute
       run-RT-transition
once.

The full path is
       $UAL/gui/run-scripts/USPAS-legacy/examples/RT-transition/run-RT-transition

Subsequently, one can just execute it's last stanza.

This is probly most natural for a user, and debugging.
