TSelector *TSelector::GetSelector(const char *filename)
{
//   The code in filename is loaded (interpreted or compiled , see below)
//   filename must contain a valid class implementation derived from TSelector,
//   where TSelector has the following member functions:
//
//     void TSelector::Init(TTree *t). Called every time a new TTree is attached.
//     void TSelector::Begin(). This function is called before looping on the
//          events in the Tree. The user can create his histograms in this function.
//
//     Bool_t TSelector::Notify(). This function is called at the first entry
//          of a new file in a chain.
//
//     Bool_t TSelector::Process(Long64_t entry). This function is called
//          to process an event. It is the user's responsability to read
//          the corresponding entry in memory (may be just a partial read).
//          Once the entry is in memory one can apply a selection and if the
//          event is selected histograms can be filled. Processing stops
//          when this function returns kFALSE. This function combines the
//          next two functions in one, avoiding to have to maintain state
//          in the class to communicate between these two funtions.
//          See WARNING below about entry.
//          This method is used by PROOF.
//     Bool_t TSelector::ProcessCut(Long64_t entry). This function is called
//          before processing entry. It is the user's responsability to read
//          the corresponding entry in memory (may be just a partial read).
//          The function returns kTRUE if the entry must be processed,
//          kFALSE otherwise. See WARNING below about entry.
//     void TSelector::ProcessFill(Long64_t entry). This function is called for
//          all selected events. User fills histograms in this function.
//           See WARNING below about entry.
//     void TSelector::Terminate(). This function is called at the end of
//          the loop on all events.
//
//   WARNING when a selector is used with a TChain: 
//    in the Process, ProcessCut, ProcessFill function, you must use
//    the pointer to the current Tree to call GetEntry(entry).
//    entry is always the local entry number in the current tree.
//    Assuming that fChain is the pointer to the TChain being processed,
//    use fChain->GetTree()->GetEntry(entry);
//
//   If filename is of the form file.C, the file will be interpreted.
//   If filename is of the form file.C++, the file file.C will be compiled
//      and dynamically loaded. The corresponding binary file and shared
//      library will be deleted at the end of the function.
//   If filename is of the form file.C+, the file file.C will be compiled
//      and dynamically loaded. At next call, if file.C is older than file.o
//      and file.so, the file.C is not compiled, only file.so is loaded.
//
//   The static function returns a pointer to a TSelector object

   // If the filename does not contain "." assume class is compiled in
