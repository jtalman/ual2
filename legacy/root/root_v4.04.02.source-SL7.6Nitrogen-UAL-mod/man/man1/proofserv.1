.SH NAME
proofserv \- PROOF (The Parallel ROOT Facility)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Using \fBPROOF\fI (The \fIP\fRarallel \fIROO\fRT \fIF\fRacility) one
can analyze trees in parallel on a cluster of computers. The
\fBPROOF\fR system consists of the \fIproofd\fR(1) from-end program
which is started via \fIinetd\fR(8).  
.PP
\fIproofd\fR takes care of user authentication and overlays itself
then with the desired version of the \fIproofserv\fR(1)
executable. 
.PP The \fIproofserv\fR(1) is a basically the same as the \fBROOT\fR
interactive module \fIroot\fR(1), except that it reads its commands
from a socket instead of from the terminal. 
.PP
Since it is a remote server it will not do graphics and therefore is
not linked with any graphics libraries (Motif, X11, etc.).
