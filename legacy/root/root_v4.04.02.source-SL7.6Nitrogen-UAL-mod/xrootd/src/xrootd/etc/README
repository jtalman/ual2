This directory contains start and stop scripts for the olbd and xrootd, as well
as a monitoring script for the olbd when you wish to use load based balancing.

The documentation for each script is contained within the script itself. Please
read the header comments in each script before using the script!

The StartOLB script starts the olbd and must have a StartOLB.cf file installed
in the same directory as the start script. This distribution includes a
StartOLB.cf.example file to guide you through setting the various variables
to the appropriate values. Please create your own StartOLB.cf file from this
example file.

The StartXRD script starts the xrootd and must have a StartXRD.cf file installed
in the same directory as the start script. This distribution includes a
StartXRD.cf.example file to guide you through setting the various variables
to the appropriate values. Please create your own StartXRD.cf file from this
example file.

You need not use the provided start/stop scripts. However, they are provided
here as a helpful aid in managing the servers.

Don't forget to modify your init scripts to start the servers at boot time!

Full documentation can be found at http://xrootd.slac.stanford.edu/
