.SH NAME
g2root \- convert GEANT geomtry files to ROOT files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B g2rootd 
.I [-f map_name] geant_name macro_name
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
You can convert a 
.B GEANT 
(see 
.I http://wwwinfo.cern.ch/asd/geant/index.html 
fore more on 
.BR GEANT )
geometry to 
.B ROOT 
geometry with the following steps
.TP 
1 
Run the interactive version of 
.B GEANT 
and produce a Zebra RZ file 
.IR detector.geom , 
by typing the command:
.sp 1 
.RS
Geant > rz/file 21 \fIdetector.geom\fR on
.RE
.sp 1
.TP
2 
Run the 
.B g2root 
program to convert the Zebra RZ file into a 
.B ROOT 
macro 
.I detector.C:
.sp 1 
.RS
g2root \fIdetector.geom\fR \fIdetector.C\fR
.RE
.sp 1
.TP 
3
Run the following 
.B ROOT 
session;
.sp 1 
.RS
.nf
root [1] .x detector.C
root [2] detector.Draw()
root [3] c1.x3d()   // (this invokes the 3-d Root viewver)
root [4] TFile f("detector.root","NEW") //open a new root file
root [5] detector.Write() //Write the geometry structure
root [6] f.Write() 
.fi
.RE
.sp 1
Note that the 
.I TNode 
structure currently in 
.B ROOT 
was not designed as a replacement for a true geometry package. The
idea was mainly to draw simple geometries in event display
programs. We are currently investigating several alternatives for a
true & efficient geometry package supporting;
.TP
- 
a disk data base with storage of multiple geometry versions
.TP 
- 
an interactive editor and viewer
.TP
- 
with 3-d views
.TP
- 
but also 2-d cut views
.TP 
- 
with interfaces to existing or future MC such as 
.B GEANT3 
or 
.B GEANT4
.PP
A second program called 
.B gh2root
(see 
.IR http://root.cern.ch/root/gh2root.html )
generates automatically C++ code corresponding to the 
.B GEANT3 Zebra 
structures 
.IR JSET , 
.IR JVERTX , 
.IR JKINE , 
.I JHITS  
and 
.I JDIGI.
