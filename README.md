Unified Accelerator Libraries for Alma Linux 9

AlmaLinux 8 is probably ok.

AlmaLinux 10 is probably ok.

The main issue is the C/C++ compiler gcc/g++.

The latest, 11.5.0, as of 6/1/2025, is mostly ok. A legacy root (CERN) build requires gcc 4.8.5 or so.

This detail, and others are covered in more depth later.
